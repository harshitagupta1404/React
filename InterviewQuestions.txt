1. What is JSX?
JSX stands for Javascript XML which allows us have HTML code inside our JS and place them in DOM without using functions like createElement, appendChild.
As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.
Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.

2. What are React Hooks?
React hooks are built-in functions which allow us to use component state and lifcycle fetaures from a functional component. React Hooks cannot be used in class components.
Rules - a) Can be called only from functional components or custom hooks.
b) They must be called at top level, not in nested functions or conditions or loops.

3. What is useState?
useState is React hook that lets function component store and manage state which persists across renders and triggers rerenders when updated.

4. Lifting State Up - Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common parent component so that multiple child components can access and update the same data.

5. ErrorBoundary - used to handle errors that occur during the render phase, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of child components.
